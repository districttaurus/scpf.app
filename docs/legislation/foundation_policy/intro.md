# Foundation Policy

Foundation Policy is the highest set of laws that governs every member of the Foundation.
- It is created by the Overseer Council.
- It can only be enforced by a foundation-wide court â€“ not department tribunals.
- A foundation court can issue punishments within departments and foundation-wide for a violation of foundation policy.
