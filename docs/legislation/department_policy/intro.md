# Department Policy

A Department Policy is tied to a specific department & governs members within that department. 
- It is created by Supervisors and Directors of a department.
- It is inferior to Foundation Policy, which should always be followed above Department Policy.
- It can be enforced by tribunals within a department (a panel of high ranking department members), or by a foundation court.
- A tribunal can only enforce punishments within a specific department, however, foundation courts reserve the right to issue foundation-wide punishment for a violation of Department Policy.

The following department policies are available publicly:
