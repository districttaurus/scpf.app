# Game Terms

## Introduction

The following rules are considered "Terms", or "Game Terms". Terms are the princple rules of gameplay which govern all players in all of our Roblox games. Breaking these terms will result in moderation action outside of the roleplay, such as a ban from some or all of our services.
